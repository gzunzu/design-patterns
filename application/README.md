## Application \[Main class\]

## Description

Application module is here just to provide an example execution of the implementation for
the sample modules corresponding to a design pattern.

It contains some resource files to provide data for the examples. You just have to run the
[`Application.main(String[] args)`](src/main/java/app/Application.java) method and watch
the output console log to witness how they work. Have fun!
