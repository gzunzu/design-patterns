# Application \[Main class\]

## Description

Application module is here just to provide an example execution of the implementation for
the sample modules corresponding to a design pattern.

It contains some resource files to provide data for the examples. You just have to run the
[`Application.main(String[] args)`](src/main/java/app/Application.java) method and watch
the output console log to witness how they work.

You can filter the example/s to execute by providing the name of the module/s as arguments
when you run the main class. Or, if you want to see them all, just provide no arguments at all.

Have fun!
