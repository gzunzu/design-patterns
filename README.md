## OOP LEARNING

This is a multi-module didactic project in which every module is a simple example of an **Object-Oriented Programming design pattern**.

Design patterns are commonly known clever solutions among the software developers for many usual challenges we face
when we are planning the arquitectural roadmap to implement our code in the best possible way, always respecting the basic
principles of OOP, such as SOLID rules.

You can read a short explanation of each pattern and the concrete implementation over the example in the README.md file
you will find in the root directory of ach module.
